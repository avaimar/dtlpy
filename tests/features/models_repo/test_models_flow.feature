Feature: Models repository flow testing

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "model_mgmt"
    And I create a dataset with a random name
    And I upload an item by the name of "test_item.jpg"
    When I upload labels to dataset
    And I upload "5" box annotation to item
    And I create a dummy model package by the name of "dummymodel"
    And I create a model form package by the name of "test-model"

  @DAT-48263
  Scenario: test flow model
    When i "train" the model
    Then model status should be "trained"
    When i "deploy" the model
    Then model status should be "deployed"
    When i "evaluate" the model
    Then model status should be "deployed"
    And Dataset has a scores file
    When i call the precision recall api
    Then i should get a json response
