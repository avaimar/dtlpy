Feature: Service entity debug mode

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "service-debug"
    And There is a package (pushed from "services/items") by the name of "services-debug"

#  @services.delete
#  @packages.delete
#  @testrail-C4533885
#  @DAT-46606
#  Scenario: Update service to debug mode - Should return <html> in response and executions should success
#    Given I create a dataset with a random name
#    And There are "5" items
#    When I create a service
#      | service_name=services-debug | package=services-debug | revision=None | config=None | runtime=None |
#    And I update service mode to "debug"
#    Then I validate service has "1" instance up
#    And I validate path "services/{service.id}/debug" get response "<html>"
#    Then I call service.execute() on items in dataset
#    And Execution was executed and finished with status "success"
#

#  @services.delete
#  @packages.delete
#  @testrail-C4533885
#  @DAT-46606
#  Scenario: Update service to regular mode - Should remove the replica
#    When I create a service
#      | service_name=services-debug | package=services-debug | revision=None | config=None | runtime=None |
#    When I update service mode to "debug"
#    Then I validate service has "1" instance up
#    When I update service mode to "regular"
#    Then I validate service has "0" instance up
