Feature: Pipeline entity method testing recomplete items

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a pipeline
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "test_pipeline_recomplete"
    And I create a dataset with a random name
    When I create a new plain recipe
    And I update dataset recipe to the new recipe


  @pipelines.delete
  @services.delete

  Scenario: pipeline re-complete status for task
    When I create a package and service to pipeline
    And I create a pipeline dataset, task "annotation" and code nodes - repeatable "True"
    And I upload item in "0000000162.jpg" to pipe dataset
    Then I wait for item to enter task
    And I update item status to "complete" with task id
    Then I wait "30"
    And I remove specific "complete" from item with task id
    Then I wait "30"
    And I update item status to "complete" with task id
    And I expect that pipeline execution has "4" success executions

  Scenario: pipeline re-complete status for qa task
    When I create a package and service to pipeline
    And I create a pipeline dataset, task "qa" and code nodes - repeatable "True"
    And I upload item in "0000000162.jpg" to pipe dataset
    Then I wait for item to enter task
    And I update item status to "approve" with task id
    Then I wait "30"
    And I remove specific "approve" from item with task id
    Then I wait "30"
    And I update item status to "approve" with task id
    And I expect that pipeline execution has "4" success executions

  Scenario: pipeline re-complete status for repeatable false task
    When I create a package and service to pipeline
    And I create a pipeline dataset, task "annotation" and code nodes - repeatable "False"
    And I upload item in "0000000162.jpg" to pipe dataset
    Then I wait "30"
    And I update item status to "complete" with task id
    Then I wait "30"
    And I remove specific "complete" from item with task id
    Then I wait "30"
    And I update item status to "complete" with task id
    And I expect that pipeline execution has "3" success executions
