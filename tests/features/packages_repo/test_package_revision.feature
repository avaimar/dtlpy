Feature: Packages revision testing

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "test_package_revision"
    And Directory "packages_create" is empty
    When I generate package by the name of "test-package" to "packages_create"

  @packages.delete

  Scenario: Update package revision Should update the package version
    When I push "first" package
      | codebase_id=None | package_name=test-package | src_path=packages_create | inputs=None | outputs=None |
    Then I receive package entity
    And I expect package version to be "1.0.0" and revision list size "1"
    When I update package
    Then I expect package version to be "1.0.1" and revision list size "2"
    When I update package
    Then I expect package version to be "1.0.2" and revision list size "3"


  @services.delete
  @packages.delete
  @testrail-C4532574

  Scenario: Update package revision and install specific service version
    When I push "first" package
      | codebase_id=None | package_name=test-package | src_path=packages_create | inputs=None | outputs=None |
    Then I receive package entity
    When I update package
    And I update package
    Then I expect package version to be "1.0.2" and revision list size "3"
    When I create a service
      | service_name=services-get | package=services-get | revision=1.0.1 | config=None | runtime=None |
    Then I validate service version is "1.0.1"

  Scenario: Update pipeline and update code node - package revision should updated
    Given I create a dataset with a random name
    When I create a new plain recipe
    And I update dataset recipe to the new recipe
    And I create a pipeline with code node
    Then I wait "4"
    And I pause pipeline in context
    And I wait "4"
    When I update pipeline code node
    Then I install pipeline in context
    And I wait "4"
    And I validate pipeline code-node service is with the correct version "1.0.1"

  Scenario: Update pipeline with code node not update the package revision
    Given I create a dataset with a random name
    When I create a new plain recipe
    And I update dataset recipe to the new recipe
    And I create a pipeline with code and task node
    Then I wait "4"
    And I pause pipeline in context
    And I wait "4"
    And I install pipeline in context
    And I validate pipeline code-node service is with the correct version "1.0.0"
