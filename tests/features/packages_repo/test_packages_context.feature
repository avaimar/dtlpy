Feature: Packages repository Context testing

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create projects by the name of "project1 project2"
    And I set Project to Project 1
    And Directory "packages_get" is empty
    When I generate package by the name of "test-package" to "packages_get"

  @packages.delete
  @testrail-C4523140
  @DAT-46568
  Scenario: Get Package from the project it belong to
    When I push "first" package
      | codebase_id=None | package_name=test-package | src_path=packages_get | inputs=None | outputs=None |
    When I get the package from project number 1
    Then Package project_id is equal to project 1 id
    And Package project.id is equal to project 1 id
