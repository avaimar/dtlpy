    Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
        Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
        And I create a project by the name of "codebases_list"
        And I create a dataset with a random name

    Scenario: List all versions when 0 exist
        Given There are "0" code bases
        When I list all code bases
        Then I receive a list of "0" code bases
