        Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch

    @DAT-46541
    Scenario: Upload items batch
        When I upload item batch from "upload_batch/to_upload"
        And I download items to local path "upload_batch/to_compare"
        Then Items in "upload_batch/to_upload" should equal items in "upload_batch/to_compare/image"
