    Scenario: Get Dataset from the checkout Project it belong to
        Given I create datasets by the name of "dataset1 dataset2"
        When I checkout project number 1
        And I get a dataset number 1 from checkout project
        Then dataset Project.id is equal to project 1 id

    Scenario: Get Dataset from the checkout Project it is not belong to
        Given I create datasets by the name of "dataset1 dataset2"
        When I checkout project number 1
        When I get a dataset number 2 from checkout project
        Then dataset Project.id is equal to project 2 id
