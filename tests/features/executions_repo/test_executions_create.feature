Feature: Executions repository create service testing

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "execution_create"
    And I create a dataset with a random name

  Scenario: Created Item Execution - Execution input object - sync
    Given There is a package (pushed from "executions/item") by the name of "execution-create"
    And There is a service by the name of "executions-create" with module name "default_module" saved to context "service"
    And I upload item in "0000000162.jpg" to dataset
    When I create an execution with "inputs"
      | sync=False | inputs=Item |
    Then I receive an Execution entity
    Then Execution was executed on "item"
