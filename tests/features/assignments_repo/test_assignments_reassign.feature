Feature: Assignments repository reassign method testing

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "assignments_reassign"
    And I create a dataset with a random name
    And There are items, path = "filters/image.jpg"
      | annotated_type={"box": 3, "polygon": 3} | metadata={"user.good": 3, "user.bad": 3} |
    And I save dataset items to context
    When Add Members "annotator1@dataloop.ai" as "annotator"
    And Add Members "annotator2@dataloop.ai" as "annotator"
    And Add Members "new_annotator@dataloop.ai" as "annotator"
    And I create Task
      | task_name=reassign | due_date=auto | assignee_ids=annotator1@dataloop.ai | items=2 |
    And I create an Assignment from "task" entity
      | assignee_id=annotator2@dataloop.ai | items=2 |
