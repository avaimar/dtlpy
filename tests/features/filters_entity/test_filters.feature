Feature: Items repository list service testing

  Background: Initiate Platform Interface and create a project
    Given Platform Interface is initialized as dlp and Environment is set according to git branch
    And I create a project by the name of "items_list"
    And I create a dataset with a random name

  Scenario: List with filters
    Given There are items, path = "filters/image.jpg"
      | directory={"/": 3, "/dir1/": 3, "/dir1/dir2/": 3} | annotated_label={"dog": 3, "cat": 3} | annotated_type={"box": 3, "polygon": 3} | name={"dog":3, "cat":3} | metadata={"user.good": 3, "user.bad": 3} |
